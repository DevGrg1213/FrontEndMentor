# FRONT END MENTOR

- Overview

# I enjoyed a lot while building this highly interactive , beautiful and real world based rating card. I found this Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor .[(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI)]. If your are interested you can check it out 😁:D

- 👉The challenge

# First of all I didn't think that I can complete this challenge but still I push myself to accept this challenge. I did not faced that much problem while building UI but It was little bit tricky at first to make it interactive with JS.

- 👉My Process

# I have designed this beautiful rating card by desktop first approach because I always prefer this method. Firstly I copied and make a variable of all the color provided by Front End Mentor. Here I set font-size to 10px at html element becuase it will be easier for me to set the over all size by inherit it. Then I started this challenge by building the rating UI and then made it interactive using Vanila JS then I build Thank you page and at last I made it responsive for mobile device by using the media query.

- 👉Build with

#HTML5
#CSS3
#Vanila JS

- 👉What I learned

# I learn a lesson that don't ever doubt yourself and just start doing things and suddenly good things will happened. I also get a chance to revise my JS knowledge which I forgeted at that thime 😅.
